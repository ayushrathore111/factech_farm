# Indian Crop Yield Prediction

## Overview
Our project focuses on predicting agricultural crop yields in India using machine learning techniques. With agriculture being a cornerstone of India's economy, accurate yield predictions can offer valuable insights for farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders to optimize crop planning, resource allocation, and risk management strategies.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to leverage historical crop data and machine learning algorithms to forecast crop yields for future seasons.

## Machine Learning Techniques for Crop yield 
We employ various machine learning algorithms for yield prediction, including:
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Extra Trees Regressor (ETR)
- Bagging Regressor (BR)
- AdaBoost Regressor (AR)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Linear Regression (LR)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)
- Decision Tree Regressor (DTR)

## Deep learning Algorithms for Disease Detection
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
## Evaluation Metrics
We assess the performance of our models using the following key metrics:
- R-squared (R2) score
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Relative Root Squared Error (RRSE)
- Relative Absolute Error (RAE)

## Data Visualization
We visualize the data using various plots such as:
- Heatmap
- Performance matrices
- Taylor diagrams

## Usage
To utilize our model and predict crop yields, follow these steps:
1. **Data Preparation**: Prepare your dataset containing historical crop data.
2. **Model Training**: Train the machine learning models using the provided algorithms.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using the specified metrics.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained models to predict crop yields for future seasons.
